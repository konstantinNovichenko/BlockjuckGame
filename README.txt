Blockjuck is a card game similar to Blackjack:
    	- Player and Dealer (computer) both get 2 cards in the beginning
   	 - Player sees all the Dealer's cards except the first one
    	- Player and Dealer decide if they want to Hit (get another card) or Stand 
    	(pass) each round
    	- The winner is the one who gets closest to 21 points without getting over it
    	- The game ends when one of the players goes over 21 or both players decide
    	to Stand
    	- Dealer's logic:  hit until reaching 19 or more
